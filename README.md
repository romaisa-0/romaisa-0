## 🧠 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer & Information Systems Engineering student at NEDUET, deeply passionate about building real-world solutions using **Machine Learning**, **Web Technologies**, and **IoT**. With hands-on experience in **Python**, **Flask**, **Django**, and ML model integration, I'm constantly exploring ways to bridge software with smart, data-driven systems.

I thrive on challenges, whether it's designing a predictive system, building a full-stack app, or optimizing user experiences. I love learning and aim to grow as a **Machine Learning Engineer** or **Full-Stack Developer**.
